# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

This is all so new to me, Im just proud of myself for how far I've come since the beginning of the week. I can now navigate a computer terminal, editor, and write basic working code, how cool!

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

Functions provide a set of instructions with a particular task to execute through blocks of code. This allows the function to be called on in repetition without having to rewrite the code, which can save a lot of time.
